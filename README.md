# Rephrase-AI | Convert lengthy PDFs into smart, concise summaries.

This repository contains the source code for my rephrase- ai website, built from the ground up with a modern, professional tech stack to showcase my skills and projects.

**Live Site**: [rephrase-ai-xvug.vercel.app](https://rephrase-ai-xvug.vercel.app/)

##  Features

- **Fully Responsive Design**  
  A clean, professional, and mobile-first user interface that looks great on all devices.

- **Stripe Integration**  
  Seamless and secure payment handling using Stripe. Supports transactions with real-time webhook verification, ensuring smooth and safe checkout experiences.

- **AI Integration with Smart Fallback**  
  Robust multi-AI system for NLP and summarization. If OpenAI GPT is unavailable due to rate limits or errors, the system automatically falls back to Google Gemini, and if that also      fails, it switches to Hugging Face â€” guaranteeing uninterrupted AI functionality.

- **Dynamic Animations**  
  Built with **Framer Motion**, including page transitions, staggered reveals, and smooth hover interactions.

- **Glassmorphism UI**  
  Semi-transparent, blurred panels for navbar, cards, and footer with a modern layered look.
